## Improvements I'd make with unlimited time

- Specialty Search Support:
Implement partial matching and performant filtering for the specialties array field. 
- Sorting Controls:
Add sortable column headers for all columns (e.g., alphabetical, numerical).
- Page Size Control:
Let users pick how many results to view per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50).
- Unit Tests:
Write tests for all components and logic, especially the useAdvocatesPage hook.
- Integration Tests:
Cover end-to-end user flows (search, reset, pagination, error cases).
- Table Sticky Columns:
Keep the first column fixed for easier scrolling on wide tables.
- Clearer Loading States:
Use skeleton loaders per row rather than opacity on the whole table.
- Authentication:
Create user, Login page and authentication checks to API
- Logging/Monitoring:
Add logging and potential tracing around API errors and performance.
- Global Theme
- Fix inital render and types issues with ORM in POST route
